# r00t3g:melte

> **NOTE:** This plugin is based on [zodern:melte](https://github.com/zodern/melte), implements Typescript and SCSS preprocessing for Svelte components, and exists only until the changes are stabilized and accepted by [@zodern](https://github.com/zodern). For now this package is made for use within one certain project and yet is not production tested and is to be used at own risk. Please read through this README thoroughly to be aware of certain limitations and drawbacks introduced by this plugin! It is highly recommended to use the original plugin from https://github.com/zodern/melte for, now unless you are 100% sure what you are doing  

Build [cybernetically enhanced web apps](https://svelte.dev) with Meteor and Svelte.

Based on [meteor-svelte](https://github.com/meteor-svelte/meteor-svelte/pull/30) with these added features:

- Tracker statements
- Support for hot module replacement (HMR) to update modified components without requiring a full page reload. Requires your app to use Meteor 2 and the [hot-module-replacement](https://docs.meteor.com/packages/hot-module-replacement.html) package.
- Handles syntax errors without crashing
- Supports Typescript preprocessing for script blocks
- Supports SCSS preprocessing and `global` attribute for style blocks

**Tested ONLY with Meteor 2.1**

## Installation

To use `r00t3g:melte`, run the following commands:

```shell
$ meteor add r00t3g:melte
$ meteor npm install svelte svelte-preprocess 
```

### Tracker Statements

In addition to the [$ reactive statements](https://svelte.dev/docs#3_$_marks_a_statement_as_reactive) Svelte normally supports, this adds `$m` tracker statements. They behave the same as normal reactive statements, but also rerun whenever any Tracker dependencies they use are invalidated. Behind the scenes, it uses [`Tracker.autorun`](https://docs.meteor.com/api/tracker.html#Tracker-autorun).

Example:

```html
<script>
const Todos = new Mongo.Collection('todos');

let sortDirection = 1;
let subReady = false;

// Tracker will unsubscribe when the Svelte component is destroyed
$m: {
  let sub = Meteor.subscribe('todos');
  subReady = sub.ready();
}

// This will rerun whenever the documents are updated or sortDirection is changed
$m: todos = Todos.find({}, { sort: { createdAt: sortDirection}}).fetch()

// You can still use normal reactive statements
$: completedCount = todos.filter(todo => todo.completed).length;
</script>

Sort by:
<select bind:value="{sortDirection}">
  <option value="-1">Oldest First</option>
  <option value="1">Newest First</option>
</select>

{#if !subReady}
  <p>Loading...</p>
{/if}

<ul>
  {#each todos as todo}
    <li>{todo.name} - {todo.createdAt}</li>
  {/each}
</ul>

<p>{completedCount} completed</p>
```

## Options

Compiler options can be specified with a `"svelte:compiler"` property in `package.json`. For example:

```json
{
  ...
  "svelte:compiler": {
    "extensions": ["svelte", "html"],
    "hydratable": true,
    "css": false
  }
}
```

**`extensions` (default: `["svelte"]`)**

An array of file extensions to be recognized by the package.
Note that HTML files are not compiled with the Svelte compiler if they contain top-level `<head>` or `<body>` elements.
Instead, the contents of the elements are added to the respective sections in the HTML output generated by Meteor (similar to what the `static-html` package does).

**`hydratable` (default: `false`)**

By default, Svelte removes server-rendered static HTML when the application is loaded on the client and replaces it with a client-rendered version.
If you want to reuse (hydrate) server-rendered HTML, set the `hydratable` option to `true` (which generates additional code for client components) and [use the `hydrate` option when instantiating your root component](https://svelte.dev/docs#Creating_a_component).

**`css` (default: `true`)**

Svelte can [extract styles for server-side rendering](https://svelte.dev/docs#Server-side_component_API).
If you want to render CSS on the server, you might want to set the `css` option to `false` so that client-rendered components don't insert CSS into the DOM.

## Preprocessing

### Scripts

Currently, only Typescript preprocessing is supported for script blocks with `lang="ts"` attribute set. 
In order to get preprocessing working, additional NPM-packages need to be installed:
```shell
$ meteor npm i --save-dev svelte-preprocess typescript
```
It is highly recommended to use TS version, supported by the Meteor release you are using.

### Styles

SCSS preprocessing is available for style blocks and is enabled for components by adding `lang="scss"` 
attribute. Just as with scripts, an installation of the toolkit is required to use SCSS reprocessing:
```shell
$ meteor npm i --save-dev svelte-preprocess node-sass
```
It is highly recommended to use node-sass (libsass) version of the SCSS compiler, however, Dart version should 
also work well.

#### Style limitations:

* In accordance with svlete-preprocess documentation, global styles are also supported, but **ONLY** by adding the 
`global` attribute and **NOT** by the `:global` rule.
  
* SCSS transformer does not use Meteor resolver which makes it impossible to imports styles from Atmosphere packages.

* For the same reason, all imports paths must be specified relatively to application root, e.g.:
```scss
@import 'client/style/theme.scss';
```
or
```scss
@import 'imports/style/variables.scss';
```

* To import files from node_modules, the import path must be prefixed with a tilde (`~`), e.g.: 
```scss
@import '~/my-awesome-library/lib/scss/library.scss';
```
or
```scss
@import '~/material-design-icons/iconfont/material-icons.css';
```

## Server-Side Rendering

`meteor-svelte` supports server-side rendering with minimal configuration.
If you import Svelte components on the server, they are automatically built for server-side rendering.
See the [Svelte API docs](https://svelte.dev/docs#Server-side_component_API), the [example app](https://github.com/meteor-svelte/ssr-example), and the `hydratable` and `css` options above for more details.

## Examples

* [Apollo integration](https://github.com/meteor-svelte/apollo-example)
* [Tracker integration](https://github.com/meteor-svelte/tracker-example)
* [Server-side rendering](https://github.com/meteor-svelte/ssr-example)
